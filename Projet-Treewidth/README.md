# Projet Treewidth

In graph theory, the treewidth of an undirected graph is an integer number which specifies, informally, how far the graph is from being a tree.

The goal of this project is to implement solutions of as many NP-complete graph problems as possible with FPT(treewidth) time complexity, given that the treewidth value of usual graphs is much smaller than their size.
