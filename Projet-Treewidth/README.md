# Treewidth Project

In graph theory, the treewidth of an undirected graph is an integer number which specifies, informally, how far the graph is from being a tree.

The goal of this project is to implement solutions of as many NP-complete graph problems as possible with FPT(treewidth) time complexity, given that the treewidth value of usual graphs is much smaller than their size.

The project also expands to other graph widths such as modular width and clique width to compare performance and identify points of strength and weakness.
